            My Love, <br>

            I know how much you dislike celebrating your birthday, but no matter how much you resist it, you will always have me—someone who is beyond excited for your special day. Happy birthday, my love!<br><br>

            I planned not to be with you at exactly midnight because I wanted to do this for you. I know you felt disappointed that I wasn’t there right away, and I’m sorry for that. But I hope you understand that I was preparing something special. I just want you to realize that no matter how indifferent you feel about today, there’s someone who celebrates it for you—with so much love and excitement.<br><br>

            Mahal, I’m sorry if I can’t give you a gift right now. I know you never pressure me about these things, but deep inside, I really want to. One day, I promise I will. Hayaan mo mahal, babawi ako sa’yo. I will study hard, find a good and stable job, and build a business—so that we can have a beautiful future together.<br><br>

            And love, I know birthdays aren’t your favorite thing. But please, never think that your life isn’t worth celebrating. You are worth celebrating—every single day. You’re not alone, mahal. The moment I became yours, you gained a partner, a best friend, and yes—your personal kalaban din minsan, mwhehehe.<br><br>

            Happy, happy birthday, my love! Please, don’t let today pass by like just any other day. I hope that after reading this, you’ll smile, feel loved, and maybe… even celebrate a little with me. Let’s go out, baby. Let’s have a date.<br><br>

            I love you—so much. Happy birthday! ❤️🎉
